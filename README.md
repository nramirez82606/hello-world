Hi!
My name is Dominique Cher Ramirez but you can call me Nikki. I want to be a veterinarian when I grew up (but maybe not in this lifetime because I already am a graduate of Business Administration course and now taking software engineering precourse with Avion School)
I would like to start YT Vlogging someday (but I don't know how because I'm an introvert and so conscious with what people around me say about me)
I love dogs. I have 5 at home and 8 at my parent's pet shop
